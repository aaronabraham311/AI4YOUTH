								<h3>Our Story</h3>
							</header>
							<p>AI4Youth Canada is a non-profit student run organization based in Calgary, Alberta. It was founded by Claire Du and Gerry Lu in June 2018. Led by their strong passion for AI, Claire and Gerry ran a peer student survey about AI awareness, then founded Western Canada High School AI Club earlier, which was the first ever high school AI club in Canada. After seeing both the very limited AI learning resources, especially the experiential learning resources that accessible to high school students and the thirsty pressing demands from students, Claire and Gerry motivated to make efforts to change and founded AI4YOUTH CANADA, they hope to combine forces to create opportunities for their peers and see more canadian youth become leaders, innovators and game changers in AI integrated future.</p>

									<h3>Claire Du</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Claire is currently a Grade 11 student at Western Canada High School, Calgary, Alberta. Fascinated by robots since elementary school, Claire has been involved in the FIRST Robotics program as a team captain, programmer, and mentored a youth robotics team. By applying her knowledge, creativity, and problem solving abilities, she hopes to inspire many to think radically about making the world a better place with technology. Combining her experience as a national level rhythmic gymnast, she innovated a carpet lifting machine that solved a labor problem for her club. Recognizing the imperative need for AI learning and as a representative for the CBE Student Advisory Council, she proposed to integrate AI fundamental courses into high school curriculums. After starting her school AI club, she worked further with like-minded individuals and founded AI4Youth Canada to empower youth across the nation to proactively become change-makers in our AI-integrated world.</p>
